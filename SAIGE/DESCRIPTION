Description: an R package that implements the Scalable and Accurate Implementation of Generalized mixed model that uses the saddlepoint approximation (SPA)(mhof, J. P. , 1961; Kuonen, D. 1999; Dey, R. et.al 2017) and large scale optimization techniques to calibrate case-control ratios in logistic mixed model score tests (Chen, H. et al. 2016) in large PheWAS. SAIGE can take dosage files in either bgen format and plain text format. Estimated effect sizes are provided. Support VCF as input format.
