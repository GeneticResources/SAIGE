\arguments{
\item{dosageFile}{character. Path to dosage file. Each line contains dosages for a marker to be tested}

\item{dosageFileNrowSkip}{integer(>=0). Number of lines to be skiped in the dosage file.}

\item{dosageFileNcolSkip}{integer(>=0). Number of columns to be skiped in the dosage file}

\item{dosageFilecolnamesSkip}{vector of characters. The column names of the skipped columns. Default: c("SNPID", "CHR", "POS", "Allele0", "Allele1")}

\item{bgenFile}{character. Path to bgen file}

\item{bgenFileIndex}{character. Path to the .bgi file (index of the bgen file)}

\item{vcfFile}{character. Path to vcf file}

\item{vcfFileIndex}{character. Path to index for vcf file by tabix, ".tbi" by "tabix -p vcf file.vcf.gz"}

\item{vcfField}{character. genotype field in vcf file to use. "DS" for dosages or "GT" for genotypes. By default, "DS".}

\item{savFile}{character. Path to sav file}

\item{savFileIndex}{character. Path to index for sav file .s1r}

\item{sampleFile}{character. Path to the file that contains one column for IDs of samples in the dosage, vcf, sav, or bgen file with NO header}

\item{idstoExcludeFile}{character. Path to the file containing variant ids to be excluded from the bgen or vcf file}

\item{idstoIncludeFile}{character. Path to the file containing variant ids to be included from the bgen or vcf file}

\item{rangestoExcludeFile}{character. Path to the file containing genome regions to be excluded from the bgen file. The file contains three columns for chromosome, start, and end respectively with no header}

\item{rangestoIncludeFile}{character. Path to the file containing genome regions to be included from the bgen file. The file contains three columns for chromosome, start, and end respectively with no header}

\item{chrom}{character. string for the chromosome to include from vcf file. If not speficied, the entire vcf will be tested}

\item{start}{numeric. start genome position to include from vcf file.}

\item{end}{numeric. end genome position to include from vcf file.}

\item{minMAC}{numeric. Minimum minor allele count of markers to test. By default, 1. The higher threshold between minMAC and minMAF will be used}

\item{minMAF}{numeric. Minimum minor allele frequency of markers to test. By default 0. The higher threshold between minMAC and minMAF will be used}

\item{minInfo}{numeric. Minimum imputation info of markers to test (in bgen file)}

\item{GMMATmodelFile}{character. Path to the input file containing the glmm model, which is output from previous step. Will be used by load()}

\item{varianceRatioFile}{character. Path to the input file containing the variance ratio, which is output from the previous step}

\item{Cutoff}{by default = 2 (SPA test would be used when p value < 0.05 under the normal approximation)}

\item{SAIGEOutputFile}{character. Path to the output file containing the SPAGMMAT test results}

\item{numLinesOutput}{numeric. Output results for how many marker each time.}

\item{IsSparse}{logical. Whether to exploit the sparsity of the genotype vector for less frequent variants to speed up the SPA tests or not for dichotomous traits. By default, TRUE}

\item{IsOutputAFinCaseCtrl}{logical. Whether to output allele frequency in cases and controls. By default, FALSE}
